It's my first C# language small project. Never used that language before.

Simple console Hangman game. Just start the game and try to guess the capitol of country.
When you guess the correct letter of the word, it will appear on console and then you will try to guess next one.
If you don't guess it you'll lost one of your five life's.
When you guess all letters  - you win - but if you lost your last life - you lose.
There should be more methods like highscores, hints etc, but unfortunately it's too hard to me to do that in expected time for today.
I wrote a small algorithm with all functions program should have.



I'm trying to code because it's that what I always wanted to do. It's my passion and now when I can code something I'm sure of that.
I'm never bored of it and I don't give up even when I can't find a solution for a long time.
Coding is my biggest dream and I love it, that's why I want to learn it and be better in that then I was yesterday.
Three months ago I even didn't know how to write simple "Hello world".
I know I still have a lot of things to learn before I can be a programmer but I'll do my best to do it.
